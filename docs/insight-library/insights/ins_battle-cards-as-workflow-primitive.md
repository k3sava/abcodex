# Battle cards become workflow primitives, not Notion pages

## Claim
Static battle cards stored in content repos go obsolete fast and stay unread. AI shifts battle cards from documents to dynamic, in-workflow tools, surfacing the right competitive intel inside the seller's deal context, generated and updated from market signals rather than quarterly PMM rewrites.

## Mechanism
A static battle card has three failures: it's not where the seller is, it's not the version they need, and nobody updates it past launch. A workflow-embedded battle card runs as a query against live competitive intel, structured by deal context (competitor in deal, persona, stage), and generated on-demand. PMMs shift from authoring static documents to curating the inputs (sources, claims, evidence) and verifying the synthesis.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The org has structured competitive intel (win/loss data, competitor product specs, sales call transcripts) available to the AI layer.
- PMMs treat curation and verification as the new primary craft.

Fails when:
- Inputs are unstructured or stale, the AI synthesises confidently wrong cards.
- PMMs cling to authoring static docs and treat the AI layer as a delivery channel for the same artifact.

## Evidence
> "AI can transform static battle cards into dynamic tools that provide real-time competitive insights directly within seller workflows." (p.1)

> "Traditional competitive battle cards, often stored in digital content repositories, quickly become obsolete in dynamic markets." (p.1)

· Gartner *Innovation Insight: Rethinking Battle Cards in the Age of AI* (G00832921), 2025-06-19. Lead author: Rahim Kaba.

## Signals
- Sellers cite battle cards by competitor + deal stage rather than by document name.
- PMM team time shifts from writing → curating + verifying.
- Competitive intel updates are continuous (each new win/loss interview, each new product release) rather than quarterly.
- Sales reps' competitive talk-track quality is measured (call transcript analysis) and feeds back into the inputs.

## Counter-evidence
Workflow-embedded battle cards depend on an AI layer that can be trusted with positioning claims, most current implementations still need PMM verification before each customer-facing use. The full automation promise may be premature; in 2026 the pattern looks more like "AI drafts, PMM ships". Operators should not over-trust the dynamic version.
