# Advisor-tool replaces ensemble-of-3 stability hacks at near-Sonnet rates

## Claim
Anthropic's advisor-tool collapses the ensemble-of-3 stability pattern into a single executor run that consults Opus mid-stream for a 400-700 token plan, then continues at Sonnet rates. Valid pairs: Haiku/Sonnet/Opus 4.6 → Opus 4.7 advisor. For long-horizon, mostly-mechanical workloads with occasional planning bottlenecks, this is the cleaner replacement for ensemble voting.

## Mechanism
Ensembles deliver stability by running multiple full inferences; the advisor pattern delivers it by inserting a small Opus-grade plan at the moment of decision, paid for once instead of N times. Cost-per-stable-decision improves because the executor stays on a cheap tier for the bulk of the work.

## Conditions
Holds when: the workload has clear planning bottlenecks (consolidation, multi-step decisions) that benefit from a higher-capability mid-stream consult.
Fails when: every step needs high-capability reasoning, there, ensemble or pure Opus still wins.

## Evidence
Anthropic advisor-tool public beta with header `advisor-tool-2026-03-01`. Sonnet executor calls Opus mid-generation for a 400-700 token plan. Verified via Anthropic Python SDK 0.97.0.

## Signals
- Long-running scheduler tasks adopt advisor-tool for the planning step.
- Cost-per-stable-decision drops vs. ensemble baseline in head-to-head bake-offs.
- Ensemble code paths retired once advisor-tool reaches GA pricing.

## Counter-evidence
For workloads requiring diversity-of-output (where ensembles vote across genuinely independent reasoning paths), advisor cannot substitute, it is one path with a smarter midpoint.
