# AI cold-call compliance follows the prospect's residence, not the seller's HQ

## Claim
AI-driven cold calling now operates at scale (qualify, respond, follow up, reroute to live agent in real time) but compliance scope is the prospect's country of residence, not the seller's HQ. Failure to comply with local laws applying to the target audience's residence can result in heavy regulatory fines, not just brand damage.

## Mechanism
Privacy and consumer-protection regimes (GDPR, TCPA, CASL, regional Indian and Brazilian laws) attach to the recipient. An AI SDR scaled across global markets touches all of them at once. Sellers who treat AI cold calling as their own jurisdiction's problem ship a compliance time bomb. Operators must design per-jurisdiction rules into the agent's workflow, consent capture, time-of-day limits, recording disclosure, opt-out routing, keyed off the prospect's residence.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The AI SDR operates internationally (any cross-border outbound).
- The privacy regime is enforceable against the seller's entity (registered presence, payment processing, etc.).

Fails when:
- The seller operates only domestically and the prospect base is single-jurisdiction, the rule simplifies.
- The regime is not enforceable in practice (some emerging markets), but operators should not bet on this; enforcement evolves.

## Evidence
> "AI cold calling is no longer experimental. Many tools are now available to engage with, qualify, respond to, follow up on the intent of, and even reroute prospects to a live agent, all in real time." (p.1)

> "Failure to comply with local laws applying to the residence of your target audience can result in heavy fines."

· Gartner *Ensure AI SDR Cold-Calling Compliance Across Global Markets* (G00801146), 2025-08-13. Authors: Igor Marchal, Michele Buckley.

## Signals
- The agent's calling logic includes per-jurisdiction guardrails (consent, time windows, disclosure language).
- Compliance review is a named gate before the agent goes live in a new market, not an after-the-fact audit.
- Opt-out and deletion requests are routed automatically to the right legal entity, not buried in an inbox.

## Counter-evidence
The compliance load can make AI SDR uneconomic in some markets where regulatory friction exceeds the productivity gain. The Gartner frame implicitly assumes the gain justifies the load; for low-volume markets, traditional outbound may be cheaper to comply with.
