# A trace alone teaches nothing; learning requires feedback attached to the trace

## Claim
Agent observability infrastructure that captures traces without attaching feedback to them is not a learning system. A trace records what happened; it does not record whether what happened was good. Without a feedback signal bound to each trace, every run is undifferentiated data, there is no gradient to learn from, no way to promote successful patterns into config, no way to demote regressions. Trace + feedback together is the minimum learning unit; either one alone is logging.

## Mechanism
Learning is differential: you need to compare runs that worked against runs that didn't, then change the system to produce more of the first kind. A trace gives you the run record, but not the label. Labels can come from explicit user feedback (thumbs / verdicts / replies), implicit feedback (downstream task completion, retention), or evaluator runs (LLM-as-judge against a rubric). All of those have to be attached to the specific trace they describe, otherwise you're rolling up averages across heterogeneous behaviour and losing the signal in aggregation. Most agent stacks ship the trace half cleanly (OTel-style spans, full I/O capture) and leave the feedback half as an afterthought, which is why so many production agents have rich logs and zero compounding improvement.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The agent runs frequently enough that a feedback corpus accrues.
- There is a meaningful signal of "good vs not good" available (human reply, downstream metric, evaluator).
- The team is willing to wire the feedback path into the same store as the trace, not a parallel one.

Fails when:
- Runs are one-shot and unrepeated (no learning loop to close).
- The signal is too noisy or too delayed to attach reliably to a specific trace.
- The team treats feedback as a product feature only ("collect ratings") and not as a learning input.

## Evidence
> "A trace tells you what happened. It does not, by itself, tell you whether what happened was good. To learn from traces, you need feedback attached to them."

The same week, Eugene Yan reached the same conclusion from the opposite direction, see `ins_mine-transcripts-to-promote-config`. Independent convergence from a frameworks operator and an evals operator on the same gap is itself a signal that the gap is structural, not stylistic.

## Signals
- Every trace in the store has a feedback row joined to it (verdict, evaluator score, user reply, or null with a reason).
- Promotion / demotion of prompts and tools to "stable" is gated on aggregate feedback, not run count.
- Drift detection alarms compare current feedback distribution to a known-good window, not just trace volume.

## Counter-evidence
- For deterministic, well-tested code paths inside an agent, traces alone can be adequate (tests already encode the "good" labels).
- Some teams successfully bootstrap with evaluator-only feedback and never collect explicit user signal; that works at small scale but typically calibrates poorly to user-perceived quality once the agent is in real production.

## Cross-references
- `ins_mine-transcripts-to-promote-config`, Eugene Yan's same-week framing of the same gap from the evals side.
- `ins_llm-wiki-pattern`, Karpathy's wiki pattern is one place where promoted patterns can land permanently.
