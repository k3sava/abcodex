# You can outsource thinking, but not understanding, verification is the new human job

## Claim
The bottleneck of AI-native work is not intelligence, it is verification. Models will produce more reasoning, more code, more drafts than any team can consume; what they cannot do is make the call about whether a given output is *right* in this specific context. Thinking can be outsourced to the model. Understanding, the calibration of "is this true, does it fit, what does it imply for the rest of the system", has to stay with a human. The implication for how teams operate: design every system so the human's role is verification, not production.

## Mechanism
LLM capability spikes where there are dense data and clean reward signals; it lags where evaluation is judgement-loaded. The human comparative advantage is the ability to integrate context the model has never seen, the unsaid requirements, the political constraints, the analogous prior failure, the way a number looks slightly off because of last quarter's incident. Calling that "understanding" instead of "thinking" reframes the workflow: production is no longer the scarce step, so production roles must redesign around verification. The teams that fight this and try to keep humans on production work get out-shipped by the teams that move humans to verification and let the model handle production. The teams that go too far and remove human verification entirely get away with it until they don't.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The work has enough novelty or context-sensitivity that verification is non-trivial.
- The org has the discipline to actually move humans off production tasks the model can do.
- Failure costs are high enough that ungated production is unsafe.

Fails when:
- The work is genuinely commodity (the verification cost approaches zero, so the role collapses).
- The model is verifiably reliable in this specific narrow task and verification is over-engineered overhead.
- The team has no shared rubric for what "right" looks like, verification reduces to taste fights.

## Evidence
> "You can outsource your thinking, but you can't outsource your understanding."

The same talk argues that verification capability is what makes some labs win and others stall. Independent convergence: Harrison Chase + Eugene Yan reached the same conclusion the following week from the agent-observability and evals angles respectively (see `ins_traces-need-feedback-to-learn`).

## Signals
- Job descriptions for IC roles list verification tasks explicitly (review, calibrate, gate) alongside production tasks.
- Reviews and retros distinguish "model produced this" from "human verified this," and the verification step has its own quality bar.
- The team can answer, for any agent in production, the question: who verifies what, on what cadence, against what rubric?

## Counter-evidence
- Some surfaces (high-volume content moderation, simple classification) are well past the threshold where human verification per-item adds value; the right design there is statistical sampling, not per-output review.
- Over-verification creates its own bottleneck: a team that gates every model output on human review caps throughput at human capacity, which in many cases is exactly the failure mode the model was supposed to fix. The discipline is to identify where verification matters and remove it elsewhere.

## Cross-references
- `ins_judgment-doesnt-compress`, Kevin Indig's parallel framing for marketing/distribution: judgement is the part that doesn't compress, even when execution does.
- `ins_traces-need-feedback-to-learn`, verification needs to be wired to the trace, otherwise the loop never closes.
- `ins_ai-judgment-and-taste-emerging`, taste as the meta-skill that survives the production-cost collapse.
