# abcodex playbook (detail layer)

CLAUDE.md has the always-on rules (voice, anti-fabrication, working agreement). This skill carries the detail.

## UX & design

- Max content width `min(1600px, 80vw)`. Every page obeys, About included.
- Body fills the section container. Do NOT cap paragraphs at 60ch / 65ch / 72ch on data-dense pages — that wraps text at ~520px inside a 1500px section. Prose-only pages (about) use a single column container (e.g. 60rem) but never per-element `ch` caps because `ch` is font-size relative.
- Typography: Newsreader serif body, Inter UI, JetBrains Mono labels.
- Tier badge: pill with leading color dot (A green, B slate, C sand). Same component everywhere.
- Animations <280ms. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` skips, doesn't shorten.
- Paper-first palette. Warm sienna accent. No saturated primary blues.
- Drop caps, pull quotes, in-card TOC for long bodies. Print stylesheet must work.
- Industrial-design thinking: nothing decorative.

## Information architecture

Cross-linking masterpiece. Every primitive is a node with explicit edges:

- Forward: insight → operator, domain, patterns, playbooks
- Reverse: operator → insights/patterns/playbooks; domain → all
- Sibling: same operator, same domain, same source
- Ancestor: domain page. Descendant: derived patterns

Edges render the same way on every page. A user entering through any door must always see ≥4 next doors.

## Accessibility (floor, not ceiling)

- WCAG AA contrast verified. `--muted: #5a6757` (5.44:1 on paper). Don't lighten.
- Skip-link is first focusable element. `main[tabindex=-1]`. Focus shifts on route change.
- Keyboard: g+h home, g+t today, g+o operators, g+p patterns, g+b browse, g+m map, j/k next/prev sibling, l listen, [/] read rate, s share, c copy citation, / search, ? help, esc close.
- ARIA: `role=status`, `aria-live=polite`. `aria-pressed` flips on actual event (e.g. `utterance.onstart`), never optimistically.
- Speech API: 60ms gap between `cancel()` and `speak()` in Chrome. Body-loaded guard before reading.
- Real device test on iOS Safari + Android Chrome before "done."

## Sharing & AEO

- Per-page share menu: native, copy, LinkedIn, X, email. Native falls back gracefully.
- Per-page OG image, distinct per insight/operator/pattern/playbook/domain.
- `Schema.org @graph` on every static page: Article + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage + Speakable per insight; Person + sameAs per operator; HowTo per playbook; CollectionPage per index; DefinedTerm per domain.
- `llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `rss.xml`, `robots.txt` (all AI bots allowed), `.well-known/agent-permissions.json`, `search-index.json`.
- Site must answer correctly when an AI agent fetches it.

## QC failure modes (these have all gone wrong)

1. Untested "done." Open browser, click thing, hear audio, see screenshot.
2. Surface vs substance. Don't ship CSS for a feature whose data isn't ready.
3. Pattern vs instance. Define the IA, render every page from same edge model.
4. Wrong counts. Re-count, then write.
5. YAML escape leaks. `'can''t'` rendering as `can"t`. Use shared `unyaml()` helper everywhere a YAML scalar is read.
6. Mobile keyboard dismissal. Programmatic `scrollIntoView` on input events dismisses iOS keyboard. Only scroll on intentional navigation.
7. Filter drawers covering result. Mobile drawer auto-collapses on selection or has explicit close. Active filters render as pill row above list.
8. Layout drift. Any page narrower than others is a bug. Width set once, not per-page.
9. Compound operators. `"Lily Ray + Britney Muller"` wrong. Split into `operator` + `co_operators[]`.
10. Emoji insertion. Never, unless explicitly asked.
11. Named reference without context. Every person, tool, company, or framework cited in body text must be introduced with enough context for a cold reader to understand why it matters. "Use Ayo Omojola's three-check filter" is not enough without saying who he is. "CI without a business question" is not enough without expanding CI on first use. If a name or acronym appears and the reader would need to search to understand why it's there, add one clause. This check must be run on the intro paragraph and every step heading.
12. Topic-label titles. Every playbook title must be a reader-facing job-to-be-done statement, not a category label. "Competitive analysis — landscape, profiles, battlecards" fails. "Run competitive analysis that arms sellers and sharpens positioning" passes. The test: does the title tell the reader what they will be able to do after reading?

## Eye for errors (Kesava's pattern)

- Fabricated URLs / identifiers
- AI patterns in body text outside operator verbatim
- Parser errors leaking through (curly where straight, escapes visible)
- Buttons that look right but don't work
- Layout drift
- Compound nouns shipping as single fields
- Counts that drift from reality
- Things shipped without verification
- Named references a cold reader cannot evaluate (QC #11)
- Title is a topic label not a JTBD statement (QC #12)

## Loop discipline

Re-apply Ogilvy / Feynman / DaVinci / Jobs lenses at end of every iteration. Not what they did when they lived — what they would do today, on the team.

Loop continues until site is twice as good as Wikipedia + Substack + LinkedIn + Medium + Podcasts combined:

- Wikipedia: every page ≥6 outbound links, reverse-links visible
- Substack: every insight has operator verbatim + plain-English distillation
- LinkedIn: tier + claim + operator readable in 3 seconds
- Medium: 65ch lines, drop caps, pull quotes, in-card TOC, reading progress
- Podcasts: listen + rate control + voice picker, working in 3 browsers, every page

Exit when all six axes hold on real devices and a fresh AI agent fetch produces correct answers from `@graph` alone.

## Round structure (active plan)

Six rounds, each = one primitive × one journey:

1. Insight page × first-time visitor
2. Operator page × returning bookmarker
3. Domain page × cross-domain explorer
4. Patterns + playbooks × synthesis seeker
5. Browse + search + timeline × directed searcher
6. AEO surface (llms.txt, schema, sitemap, OG) × AI agent

Each round commits separately. Within each, the primitive gets full IA + voice + visual + friction + schema + mobile + listen + perf, and the journey gets walked end-to-end on a real device before moving on.
