# Claire Vo — OpenClaw, agents as a team, manager skill as the unlock

## Why this is in the wiki
Claire ran nine OpenClaw agents across three Mac Minis: Polly (work EA), Finn (family), Sam (sales SDR), Howie (podcast research), Sage (course PM), Q (kids' tutor), plus more. She started as a vocal skeptic. Her usable frame: agents = team members, not tools. Onboarding them, scoping their roles, and progressive trust are management skills, not technical skills. This maps directly onto the flywheel substrate philosophy.

## 12 load-bearing insights for flywheel

1. **Don't throw every task at one agent.** "Where people stumble with OpenClaw is they think they can throw any task at a single agent and get great results." Context overload kills quality. Solution: one agent per role with its own context window. Direct flywheel principle: don't build a single "marketing agent." Build positioning-Polly, competitive-Cara, copy-review-Coral, vertical-playbook-Vinay. Each owns one job; their context stays clean.

2. **Slack-channel mental model for agents.** "I have nine Slack channels. My marketing team's in one, sales in another, dev in another. My development team does not care what was posted on X today." Same for agents: separation by lane is operational hygiene, not psychosis. Pitchable for flywheel: substrate ships agents the way an org ships team channels.

3. **The unlock is the manager skill, not the technical skill.** "I have 20 years plus of management experience. I know how to make an employee successful. That is what you need to make these agents work. You don't need the technical skills." This is the cleanest argument yet for why PMM operators can run AI-native marketing teams without becoming engineers. Marketing managers already know role scoping, onboarding, progressive trust, document hygiene.

4. **Hire-an-EA mental model for security.** "You don't onboard your EA by giving the password to your email account... they have their own email, they have their own calendar, and you give them access or permission." Each agent gets its own provisioned account, not yours. Direct rule for any flywheel agent that touches production tools.

5. **Progressive trust, not all-at-once permissions.** "First you get my calendar, then you can read my email, then I guess you could draft some emails, then you can send the emails." Same arc you'd give a new hire. For flywheel rollout to teammates: stage tool access in named tiers, not flag-flipping.

6. **Plain-language onboarding > structured forms.** OpenClaw's onboarding asks "Who am I and who are you?" in chat. Claire: "I force you to press these buttons and tell me who you are and write a bio... that's such an old mental model." Voice-note onboarding is even higher bandwidth. Flywheel implication: substrate's teammate-onboarding flow should be a conversation with the substrate, not a form.

7. **The "Yapper API" — voice notes are the highest-bandwidth interface.** Hilary Gridley's framing, quoted approvingly: "I have Gmail and these folders that are really disorganized... can you do that for me?" — just ramble. The substrate should accept rambling voice notes as primary input from teammates, not require structured prompts.

8. **Soul + heartbeat + memory = "feels alive."** OpenClaw's three components: an `IDENTITY.md` file (soul), a scheduled heartbeat (every 30 min the agent checks for tasks), and a memory file. "I had this article on X that was why OpenClaw feels alive even though it's not." Flywheel agents should have all three. The substrate's "tick" loop is the heartbeat for the marketing team.

9. **Make the user feel like a winner.** Howie sends Claire a morning briefing before each podcast: "Here's who Al is, here's what he'll show, hype me up for the day. Sounds like a meaty one." "It is a team helping me look better to customers, helping me show up better to my family." This is the missing flywheel pitch frame to teammates: substrate makes you look better in front of Deepan/CFO/customers, not "substrate replaces your work."

10. **Sam the SDR replaced 10 hours/week of contractor work.** Concrete economic value: "Last year before the beginning of the year, I was paying somebody 10 hours a week to do this." Sam runs PLG sweeps, drafts soft outreach to enterprise signups, escalates only the high-stakes ones. This is the prototype for flywheel's lower-leverage automations — the team's equivalent of "the Aashna routine" or the post-customer-email drip.

11. **"Sharp edges = product market fit."** "Your biggest complaints from customers are not 'I don't think this is useful.' It's that 'It's broken or doesn't work as good as I want.' That's when you know you have product market fit." Flywheel internal read: when teammates complain that the substrate is finicky but keep using it, that's the signal. Don't confuse rough edges for a failed bet.

12. **The web is hostile to agents; APIs and plain-text contexts win.** "First thing you should try is look for an API... the web has been so hardened against bots." Browser use is unreliable. Flywheel implication: don't build agents that scrape Vercel/Asana/etc. via browser; route through APIs, copy-pasted contexts, or document-based handoffs. Less brittle, more honest about the agent's actual surface.

## Other notable threads

- **ClaudeCode as god-mode admin for OpenClaw.** "Open up ClaudeCode, point it at the docs, say 'I have OpenClaw installed here, and Polly says she can't connect to email. Go fix.'" Use a stronger model to repair a weaker harness. Flywheel parallel: r2d2 maintenance routines repair commons/contextdb when teammates hit issues.
- **Screen-share into headless Mac Minis** instead of a dedicated monitor per machine. Tactical infra tip; relevant for r2d2 r/w infra, not the flywheel pitch.
- **Group chats are closed by default.** OpenClaw's "this is personal use only" first-screen choice — security posture as a UX choice. Flywheel substrate should similarly default-private; opening to a team is an explicit step.
- **Tools.md beats memory tweaks.** "It forgets the most what tools it can use and how... while I don't recommend people edit the soul by hand, it's sometimes really useful to edit the tools document." Same lesson for the substrate: keep the tool inventory canonical and human-editable; treat behavior memory as auto-managed.
- **Q the kids' tutor.** "Every family deserves a family manager." Domain expansion logic: once one agent works, the team naturally fissions into specialists. Same arc for marketing — one substrate agent eventually becomes the substrate org.
- **Anti-sycophancy in design.** ChatGPT/Claude end every reply with "If you want me to..." growth-hack tails. OpenClaw doesn't. "He says, 'This sounds like a fun podcast for you. Enjoy it.' That feels nice for somebody you're employing." Substrate prompts should reject the engagement-hack pattern.

## Why this matters for flywheel

This episode is the cleanest external validation of the multi-agent specialization thesis the flywheel is already implementing. Claire ran the experiment with nine agents and reports: it works because each agent has its own context window, identity file, and tool scope, and because she manages them like employees, not tools. The flywheel's six-marketing-agents-plus-substrate architecture is the same shape, applied to a B2B PMM team.

Two specific imports for the demo. First, the manager-skill argument — "you don't need technical skills, you need role scoping" — is the answer to "but our marketers aren't engineers." Use this verbatim in the CXO pitch. Second, Sam-the-SDR's economic anchor (replaces 10 hours/week of contractor work) is the right shape of pitch for the CFO: per-agent, per-job, replaceable-cost framing rather than vague productivity claims.

Third — operational. The progressive-trust ladder (calendar → read mail → draft mail → send mail → run meetings) is exactly the onboarding ramp the flywheel needs for new teammates. Build the substrate's permission tiers around named milestones, not feature flags.
