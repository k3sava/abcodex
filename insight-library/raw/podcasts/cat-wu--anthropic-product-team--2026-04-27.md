# Cat Wu — How Anthropic's product team moves faster than anyone else

Full transcript: `PplmzlgE0kg.transcript.txt` (16,644 words). VTT source: `PplmzlgE0kg.en.vtt`.

## 15 load-bearing insights

1. **Timelines collapsed: 6 months → 1 month → 1 week → 1 day.** Cat's team ships most features in *research preview* within a week. The PM's job shifted from "align multi-quarter roadmaps with partner teams" to "find the fastest path from idea to user's hands." Branding things as "research preview" reduces commitment cost; lets you ship in a week or two.

2. **Process-light culture, but tight cross-functional rituals.** Engineers post in an "evergreen launch room" when a feature is dog-fooded; Sarah (Docs) + Alex (PMM) + Tar/Lydia (DevRel) jump in and turn the marketing announcement around the next day. The PM's job is to set up the framework so any engineer can ship something with almost no PM involvement.

3. **PRDs are conditional, not default.** What replaces them: rigorous weekly metrics readouts + a "team principles" doc that names key users, why they're key, and what the team is willing to trade off. Goal: anyone on the team can decide without being blocked on a stakeholder. PRDs reappear for ambiguous features and heavy-infrastructure projects.

4. **Hire engineers with product taste, not more PMs.** "There are many engineers on our team who are fully able to end-to-end go from see user feedback on Twitter through to ship a product at the end of the week with almost no product involvement. This I think is actually the most efficient way to ship something." Engineering and PM are merging; both designers and PMs land code.

5. **Product taste is the scarce skill.** "As code becomes much cheaper to write, the thing that becomes more valuable is deciding what to write." Comes from any background. Engineering background helps for the next few months because you have a sense of how hard something should be — feeds prioritization.

6. **First-principles thinking + low-ego + wear many hats.** Work is becoming amorphous. Great PMs see gaps, figure out the highest-priority one, and either learn the skill or apply an existing one. The current environment values people willing to swap roles to help the team move faster.

7. **Mission above product KRs.** "If Cloud Code failed but Anthropic succeeded, I would be extremely happy." Teams trade their own KRs for org goals. Cat distinguishes mission (willing to sacrifice for) from focus (saying no to adjacent ideas). Both matter; mission is the stronger force.

8. **Product consistency is sacrificed for speed.** Anthropic intentionally ships overlapping features and lets users tell them which form factor wins. The cost: new users have to be educated. Mitigation: in-product flows like `/powerup` that walk users through best practices — they'd previously rejected this as un-intuitive but caved when the surface area got too large.

9. **The right amount of AGI-pilled.** "It is very hard to be the right amount of AGI-pilled. It's very easy to build the product for the super-AGI strong model. The hard thing is figuring out for the current model how do you elicit the maximum capability?" Build for the *current* model's strengths while patching weaknesses; shed the patches as models improve.

10. **A lot of new-model work is *removing* features.** "A lot of the changes with a new model is removing features that are no longer needed." Many features are crutches for model weakness (e.g. the to-do list was added because Claude would stop after 5 of 20 refactor sites; Opus 4 made it natural; the to-do list is now de-emphasized). Every model launch they re-read the entire system prompt and remove sections the new model doesn't need.

11. **Build products that don't yet work.** Be at the edge of what's possible so when the next model lands you swap it in and the gap closes. Code review was tried multiple times before Opus 4.5/4.6 + Sonnet 4.6 made multi-agent code review reliable enough to gate merges on.

12. **Trusted feedback group of 5 > broad surveys.** "There's a handful of people who are much better than others at articulating what makes a specific model or model harness combination good." Find them. Use team-lunch vibe-checks ("what's your vibe on this model?") to surface hypotheses; then mine data to verify.

13. **10 great evals > 100 bad ones.** Evals quantify the goal and progress. Cat jumps in personally when a feature needs tighter product definition; output is "5 evals, here's how to run them, here's the prompt that increases success rate."

14. **Model-introspection-as-debug.** Ask the model why it made a decision. "Sometimes the model will say there was something confusing in the system prompt, or it delegated verification to a subagent and didn't check its work." Use the introspection to fix the harness, not just the prompt.

15. **The 100%-automation rule.** "If an automation doesn't work 100% of the time, it's not really an automation. That last 5-10% takes more time." Most users give up at 95%. Building automation is slower than doing the task once; the payoff is repeated runs at 100%.

## Other notable threads

- **Tool stack:** Claude Code (CLI for one-off coding) + Claude Desktop (front-end work, preview pane, control plane for all sessions) + Claude on web/mobile (kick off tasks on the go) + Co-work (everything non-code: decks, briefs, Slack-zero, inbox-zero) + Slack (the OS of the company).
- **Co-work usage example:** Cat fed Co-work the conference-talk narrative + PMM's draft + design-system slide template; Co-work walked Twitter, the launch room, and the demos channel for an hour and produced a 20-page deck overnight. Manual would have taken hours.
- **Internal tools surge:** Cloud Code lowered the barrier to making personalized work-software. Sales-team member built a custom-deck app pulling from Salesforce + Gong + notes to produce per-customer-tailored Cloud Code decks in seconds vs 20-30 minutes manual.
- **Token economics:** Token cost per knowledge-worker rises with each model jump but is still much lower than salary cost. Anthropic trusts individuals to make the cost call; "frowned upon to waste tokens" but no hard caps for most.
- **Org shape:** ~30-40 PMs across Research PM, Cloud Developer Platform, Cloud Code (covers Cloud Code + Co-work core), Enterprise (RBAC, security controls, cost), and Growth.

## Augmented from Dropbox transcript 2026-04-28

The original synthesis was built from YouTube auto-subtitles (~1.2K words). The Dropbox-archived full transcript (~16K words) surfaces additional load-bearing material below.

### 16. **Evergreen launch room as the unit of shipping velocity** — The process Cat describes at Anthropic is hyper-specific: engineers dog-food internally, post to an "evergreen launch room," and Sarah (Docs), Alex (PMM), Antaric/Lydia (DevRel) turn around marketing announcements the next day. This is not async Slack hand-offs; it's a tight ritual. The PM's job is to set up the framework and lower friction.

### 17. **Co-work's synthesis example: 1 hour → 20-page deck** — Cat fed Co-work her conference-talk narrative, PMM's draft, and design-system templates. Co-work walked Twitter, the evergreen launch room, and the Claude Code announced channel for an hour and produced a 20-page deck. "There were a few tweaks" (slide wordiness), but the artifact had "Anthropic designer" polish. This is the "substrate-as-draft-engine" moment flywheel is targeting — not "AI helps a human," but "AI owns the draft, human reviews it at 20% and 80% checkpoints." The internal-demos channel feed is the data source; Commons rooms + ledger are flywheel's equivalent channels.

### 18. **Metrics readouts + team principles = distributed decision-making** — Two mechanisms enable engineers to ship without PM blocking: (a) weekly metrics readouts with the whole team so everyone understands goal trajectories and drivers, (b) a "team principles" doc naming key users, why they're key, and what the team trades off. Both are public and legible. Flywheel equivalent: a shared "growth principles" doc in Commons (ICP, brand voice, acceptable quality trade-offs) so any teammate can decide on a copy iteration without escalating.

### Concrete operational details missed in original
- Anthropic org: ~30-40 PMs across Research PM, Cloud Developer Platform, Cloud Code, Enterprise, Growth (role stratification, not product-org overlap)
- Token economics: no hard caps for most employees; individually trusted to make cost calls. Frowned-upon-to-waste culture, not metered.
- Model launch process: entire system prompt gets re-read; features that are crutches for old model weaknesses get de-emphasized or removed (to-do list was model-weakness patch; Opus 4 made it natural; now de-emphasized)

### Notable side-quests
- Sales-team member built a custom-deck app (using Cloud Code) pulling from Salesforce + Gong + notes to produce per-customer-tailored decks in seconds. Solo engineer, Claude-written. This is "internal tool surge" — shows how collapsed time-to-build creates a second wave: non-engineers demand personalized work-software.

## Why this matters for flywheel

This is an operating model that transposes from Anthropic's product team to a modern marketing team.
