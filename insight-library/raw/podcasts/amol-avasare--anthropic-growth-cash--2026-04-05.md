# Amol Avasare — Anthropic growth, CASH, and the squeezed PM

## Why this is in the wiki

Pair to the YouTube Amole Naik episode — different guest, same org, more operational detail. Direct evidence for the flywheel pitch: Anthropic's growth team is *already* automating its own experimentation pipeline, and the bottleneck shifted from engineering to PM-side stakeholder alignment. That is the flywheel hypothesis stated by an operator running it.

## Insights

### 1. CASH = Claude Accelerates Sustainable Hypergrowth

Anthropic's growth-platform team (Alexey Komissarouk) runs CASH: Claude generates growth experiments end-to-end across four stages — identify opportunities, build the change, test/quality-bar, ship-then-analyze. Win rate today is "junior PM 2-3 yrs in," not senior PM. Wasn't possible before Opus 4.5; works now. Brand and quality guardrails encoded as skills with explicit dos/don'ts. Human-in-loop for now; review need decreasing weekly.

### 2. The four-stage automation loop (verbatim spine)

> Identify opportunities → build the feature → test against quality + brand bar → ship + analyze.

The fifth stage — cross-functional stakeholder alignment — is the human holdout. Quote: "We will have AGI and it will still be impossible to get six people in a room to align." Direct mapping for flywheel: substrate handles 1-4, humans own taste + decisions + creative + alignment.

### 3. Squeezed PM thesis

Default team: 5 eng + 1 designer + 1 PM. Claude Code 2-3x's engineering. The team effectively becomes 15-20 eng + 1.5-2 PM + 1.5-2 design. Result: PM and design are *the* bottleneck. Two responses inside Anthropic: (a) hire more PMs, (b) deputize product-minded engineers as mini-PMs for sub-2-week projects. Two-week rule: under 2 weeks of eng → engineer drives, PM advisory; over 2 weeks → PM accountable.

### 4. PM should not ship — at scale

Counter to Twitter conventional wisdom. With 20 engineers and 1-2 PMs, the highest-leverage PM use of time is *up-leveling the why and what* by 5%, not shipping the 21st feature. Shipping for *learning* (prototype to communicate an idea) still valid. PRDs largely dead — 70-80% of Anthropic ships have no PRD; just Slack + good engineers.

### 5. Quality drives growth (Mercury onboarding as canonical case)

Single highest-impact growth quarter of his career: at Mercury, ditched all metric-chasing for one quarter and just fixed quality in the onboarding flow. Onboarding-start to completion uplift was massive. Lesson: in regulated/complex flows, quality *is* the growth lever. Transferred verbatim to Anthropic onboarding.

### 6. Right friction beats no friction

Time-to-value-cut-everything is the wrong default. MasterClass quiz, Calm quiz, Mercury multi-step splits, Anthropic intent-questions — all add friction, all win. Rule: cut friction that doesn't help users understand the product *for them*; keep friction that does. Bonus: the data captured up-funnel powers lifecycle + lookalike targeting downstream.

### 7. Bigger bets when AI is the core value prop

Traditional growth = 70% small/medium, 30% larger swings. Anthropic flips it: 50/50 or 70/30 toward larger bets. Reason: when product value compounds 1000x in two years, capturing exponential upside requires bigger swings; small optimizations leave the forest for the trees. Constraint: only applies if AI is *the* value prop, not a side feature.

### 8. The Slack-MCP misalignment scan

Operating pattern Kesava can copy tomorrow: Cowork (Claude desktop) + Slack MCP, scheduled weekly. Prompt: "Look across Slack, here are projects I'm running, find me areas of misalignment." Catches conflicts before they cost cycles. Same pattern across direct reports: feedback drafts based on goal docs + meeting transcripts + this week's Slack. "Soft coaching" — coach is sometimes drunk, but signal getting better fast.

### 9. The morning Cowork dashboard

Scheduled task on Cowork desktop reads 20-25 Hex charts every morning, summarizes anomalies + insights. Same pattern with Chrome extension on dashboards without MCPs. Long-tail chart-watching that no human would do daily, now done automatically with declining false-pos/false-neg as confidence accrues.

### 10. Org structure: horizontals + audience pods

40-person growth org. Horizontals (growth platform, monetization) cut across products. Audience pods (Claude Code, Cowork, knowledge worker, B2B, API) own funnel for that audience and pair tightly with the product team. When you have multiple products, pure-funnel teams don't work — audience focus + cross-functional embedding does.

### 11. Cold email as growth-PM tryout

Got the role by cold-emailing Mike Krieger. The cold email *was* the interview. Subject-line copy is "tested, secret." Use personal email not work email; LinkedIn outreach is over-saturated. Follow up until they say stop.

### 12. Freedom through constraints

Anthropic was the smallest, least-funded entrant. Constraint forced the focus on coding + B2B from 2021 (Ben Mann doc). Coding wasn't just a TAM bet — it was a *research-acceleration* bet. Best models → faster code → faster research → better models. Self-reinforcing loop, exactly like the flywheel structure.

### 13. Leave money on the table

Core growth-team principle: "We are comfortable forgoing metric impact to prioritize safety, brand, quality bar, UX." Mistake new growth practitioners make = squeezing every last dollar. The best products never operate that way. Ties safety-as-competitive-advantage to long-run growth.

## Other threads worth tracking

- **Capability overhang** — model ships, takes weeks to figure out the right product on-ramps, by then next model ships and learnings are stale. This *is* the activation problem in AI, named.
- **Anthropic almost shipped a chatbot before ChatGPT** — pulled it for safety reasons. Counterfactual: if launched, maybe Anthropic = consumer giant and OpenAI takes the focused B2B path.
- **Log-linear chart culture** — internally, linear charts are uncool. "Show me at log-linear scale." A small artifact of a hyperbolic-growth operating culture.
- **Spike doubled-down beats weakness-fixed** — for PMs surviving the AI transition: identify your one impact-tied skill (craft, alignment, taste), forget the weaknesses, become the best at that.

## Why this matters for the flywheel

This is the most-direct empirical match to the flywheel pitch in the entire Lenny corpus to date. CASH = the four-stage substrate. The squeezed-PM thesis = the staffing argument (Sourav, Reshma, Aditi, Akhil, Bharat, Sulagna level into GTM-engineers via substrate while routine work compresses). Two-week rule = a clean delegation primitive. Slack-MCP misalignment scan + morning Cowork dashboard = two ready-to-clone Day-1 demos for Deepan. "We forgo metric impact for brand" = the CFO Showcase frame: revenue per employee + taste, not metric-squeeze.

Most-load-bearing transferable rules:
- Substrate + human-in-loop, where humans own alignment and brand decisions
- Larger bets when AI is the core value prop
- Quality drives growth (counter-narrative to optimization-theater)
- PMs at scale should up-level the why and what, not ship more features
