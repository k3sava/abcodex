# Archie Abrams — Churn Optimization & Long-Term Holdout Experiments

**Why this is in wiki:**
Archie is VP of Product & Growth at Shopify (~600-person org, 10% of US e-commerce, $235B GMV 2023). His framework inverts the retention obsession most SaaS companies carry: Shopify optimizes for churn because its business model (payments + subscriptions) rewards the outlier winners who scale massive. This is the operating model playbook for AI-native PMM — long-term measurement discipline, taste over KPIs, power-law thinking applied to user cohorts.

## Why Churn Optimism Works at Shopify (Not Just SaaS Meme)

The mental model:
- **Most merchants fail.** That's the deal. Lower barriers to entry → maximize trial → let winners emerge.
- **Revenue follows the distribution.** Subscription fees are dwarfed by payment fees from successful merchants. The 20% who succeed generate 10x the value of the 80% who tried and churned.
- **NRR Fallacy:** Typical SaaS obsesses over per-customer retention. Shopify instead focuses on: *total GMV from a cohort over 1-5 years.* This is a power-law metric. The few massive wins justify the entire cohort acquisition.

Direct quote: *"We want to lower barriers to get started and help folks grow, and those winners make the whole thing work."*

Parallel: angel investing. Most investments fail; the unicorn pays for the portfolio.

## The 30-40% Surprise: Short-Term Lifts That Evaporate

**This is the load-bearing insight for flywheel budget allocation:**

Archie runs long-term holdout experiments (5% holdout on every change, or 50/50 on new-user cohorts, tracked 1–3 years downstream).

**Finding: 30-40% of experiments showing short-term lift (paying signup, first sale) show NO incremental GMV lift after 1 year.**

Why?
1. **Pull-forward effect** — you're just accelerating inevitable signups, not creating new value.
2. **Lower-quality users** — discount attractions bring in less viable merchants.
3. **Rarely negative downstream** — Archie has never seen short-term positive flip to long-term negative. So safe to ship. But don't take credit.

**Operational implication:** If you're shipping 10 growth experiments, 3-4 of them are probably theater. Long-term measurement closes that gap.

## Shopify's Org Structure: Three Time Horizons

Shopify doesn't have one unified north star. Instead:

1. **Core Product** — 100-year vision from CEO Tobi. No KPIs. Taste + intuition. Decisions made for "right things for commerce in 100 years."
2. **Merchant Services** — Payments, shipping, tools. Medium-term (2-5y) horizon. Some metrics, but secondary.
3. **Growth** — End-to-end customer journey. Short-term wins matter. But long-term holdouts oversee everything.

**Key rule:** Teams deliberately think on *different* time horizons. Alignment is on mission, not metrics.

## Monetary Friction as a Lever

The most consistent win Archie cites: **reduce monetary friction** (trial length, pricing, credits, cash-back incentives).

Conventional wisdom: Discounts attract low-quality users.
Shopify finding: Giving merchants a *bit more runway* causally increases survival. They have more time to validate their idea before the monthly $39 subscription bite kicks in.

**Why this works:** You're not filtering. You're extending the opportunity for a viable merchant who would otherwise give up.

## Experiment Infrastructure & Holdout Discipline

- **Every change:** 5% always-on holdout (shipped to 100%, cohort tracked forever).
- **New-user experiments:** 50/50 split for weeks, then ship to 100%; revisit cohort 1y/2y/3y later.
- **Automation:** Experimenters get emailed updated results at 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month marks. *You can't hide from reality.*
- **Governance:** One change per quarter. Deep causality focus.

This is the opposite of "run 100 tests, see what sticks."

## Absolute Numbers Over Conversion Rates

**The anti-pattern:** Teams optimize for their stage's conversion rate. Signup→Onboard team tries to move 10%→12% conversion.

**The trap:** It's *easiest* to increase conversion rate by making the previous stage harder. Fewer people through → higher rate. Perverse incentive.

**The fix:** Optimize for *absolute count of people reaching your stage*, not the percentage.

**Corollary:** Lowering signup friction (easier to enter) hurts conversion rate (more low-intent users) but increases absolute activated merchants. CAC goes down. You can spend more to acquire more. Net win.

Archie on this: *"Because that will always hurt your conversion rate, but it may actually give you more people on the outside."*

## Operational checklist

1. **Long-term holdout experiments:** Instead of shipping based on 2-week CR lift, track cohort GMV/ARPU for 6+ months. 30-40% of wins are illusion; discipline catches it.
2. **Absolute customer count over rates:** If an SMB add-on drives signup rate down 8% but adds 20 new customers, that's a win. Measure both, optimize for total volume.
3. **Monetary friction as growth lever:** Trial optimization, onboarding credits, pricing tiering — test these constantly. Shopify's most reliable playbook.
4. **Org structure for taste:** Core product team sets vision (no KPIs). Growth team executes with discipline. Alignment on direction, not metrics.
5. **Power-law thinking:** 20% of customers/segments will drive 80%+ of value. Invest disproportionately in identifying and supporting that 20%. Churn from the 80% is not a failure.

## Other Threads

- Shopify doesn't care about per-merchant LTV retention. Only about total merchant success & ecosystem growth.
- Tobi (CEO) has a documented 100-year vision that cascades to all product decisions. This top-down clarity is the substrate for bottom-up metric freedom.
- Sign-up flow, onboarding personalization, and guidance are the most reliable levers (aside from monetary friction).

## Why This Matters

This episode is a useful operating manual for how AI-native companies should think about growth, measurement, and taste. Archie proves that:
- You can build at 10% US e-commerce scale *without* dogmatic KPI attachment.
- Power-law thinking (winners justify the losers) is structurally superior to average retention thinking.
- Long-term measurement is an unfair advantage; most companies are too impatient to run 1-year holdouts.
- Monetary friction is the most reliable lever across SMB/merchant products.
