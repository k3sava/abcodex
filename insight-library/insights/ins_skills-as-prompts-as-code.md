# Prompts are code, Skills deserve testing, documentation, dependency mapping, performance profiling

## Claim
Skills are super-leveraged prompts and require engineering rigor: treat prompts as code. Observed across 100+ early Skills adopters, the same week-one problems repeat, name collisions, dependency confusion, untested behavior, performance surprises. The fix is to apply software-engineering discipline (testing, documentation, dependency mapping, performance profiling) to prompt artifacts rather than treating them as one-off natural-language requests.

## Mechanism
A Skill that runs in production for many sessions accumulates the same maintenance burden as a small library: silent regressions, breaking changes downstream, undocumented assumptions. Without engineering discipline these failures are invisible until they cause user-visible breakage. Applying explicit testing (does the Skill produce the expected behavior on N inputs?), documentation (what does the Skill assume? what depends on it?), and performance checks (is the latency budget respected?) catches the failures before they propagate.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- Skills are used in production workflows where reliability matters.
- The team has the engineering culture to invest in prompt-as-code discipline.

Fails when:
- One-off exploratory chat sessions where engineering discipline is overhead.
- Solo experimentation where the user is the only consumer and silent failures are tolerable.

## Evidence
> "Skills are super-leveraged prompts requiring engineering rigor — treat prompts as code."

## Signals
- Skills repository has tests, version control, and documented dependencies.
- New Skills go through review like code, not just immediate deployment.
- Performance regressions in Skills are caught by monitoring, not by user complaint.

## Counter-evidence
For exploratory or rapidly-iterating prompt work, full software discipline can slow iteration to a crawl. Some teams find a lightweight middle ground (lints + smoke tests) more effective than full engineering rigor.
