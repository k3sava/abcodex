# The dark factory: nobody reads the code, gated by a simulated QA swarm

## Claim
StrongDM has been operating since August 2025 under a two-rule progression: (1) nobody types code, (2) nobody reads code. They make this safe by running a simulated swarm of thousands of agent-employees against a vibe-coded simulated stack (Slack, Jira, Okta, the works), 24/7, at roughly $10K/day in tokens.

## Mechanism
The cost of simulating dependencies has collapsed. Building a fake Slack, fake Jira, fake Okta used to be a six-month project; now agents build them from API docs in days. Once the simulated dependencies exist, you can run continuous adversarial-style QA at scale that no human team could match. The simulator catches regressions earlier than any human review, so the human-in-the-loop on individual PRs becomes redundant. Read-the-code discipline shifts from line-level review to suite-level test coverage.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The product has well-defined surfaces with API docs that can be simulated.
- The team has the operating discipline and budget to run agent swarms continuously.
- The token economics work, token spend < salary saved.

Fails when:
- The product's correctness depends on physical-world or human-judgment outputs the simulator can't cover.
- The org has not invested in the simulation harness, without it, "nobody reads code" is reckless.

## Evidence
> "The cost of simulating those dependencies has crashed... They've built simulated employees that work in a simulated Slack, simulated Jira, simulated Okta — and these are running 24/7 testing their access management software."

· Simon Willison on Lenny's Podcast, 2026-04-02

Token spend reported as ~$10K/day. StrongDM ships security software, the case where you'd most expect line-level review to be irreducible.

## Signals
- Token cost runs higher than the salary cost they replace, but is rising slower than throughput.
- New regressions are caught by the simulated swarm before reaching staging.
- Human time shifts from PR review to harness improvement, eval design, and exception triage.
- Engineers rarely open the code, they read the swarm's reports.

## Counter-evidence
For most companies, "nobody reads code" is premature. The simulator is the load-bearing piece, and most teams have neither the budget nor the discipline to maintain a live simulated environment. The pattern transfers earliest in security, where adversarial coverage is the existing review model anyway. Marketing-side analog requires a synthetic-buyer simulator, not a synthetic-employee simulator, different shape, partly built (Nooks-style SDR practice tools), not yet at "nobody reads the copy" maturity.
