# Plan for semi-autonomous agents, fully autonomous is not ready for most enterprise use cases

## Claim
Enterprise leaders should design AI agent deployments around semi-autonomous patterns with explicit human supervision, not fully autonomous workflows. Fully autonomous agents are not production-ready for most enterprise use cases, and human oversight remains essential to keep the work safe, attributable, and reversible.

## Mechanism
Current LLM-based agents are varied in capability, brittle on long-horizon tasks, and prone to confidently wrong outputs. Architecting for full autonomy means the agent's failures land on customers and balance sheets directly. Architecting for semi-autonomy, agents that propose, retrieve, draft, or execute within bounded scope while humans approve, audit, or intervene at named checkpoints, keeps blast radius contained while still capturing most of the productivity gain. The autonomy spectrum is the design surface, not a binary on/off.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The use case has reversible or low-stakes outputs (drafts, classifications, retrievals).
- The org can sustain named human checkpoints (review queues, approval gates) without bottlenecking the loop.

Fails when:
- Treated as a perpetual rule, for narrow well-bounded tasks (deterministic transformations, structured extractions) full autonomy works fine and the supervision overhead becomes the bottleneck.
- The "supervision" is theatrical (rubber-stamp queues nobody reads), risk returns without the productivity gain.

## Evidence
> "In practice, fully autonomous agents are not ready for most enterprise use cases, and human oversight remains essential. Semiautonomous deployments, where there is some human supervision of the work of AI agents, are what enterprises must plan for." (p.2)

> Adoption curve cited as the most aggressive among emerging tech in Gartner's 2026 CIO survey: "Only 17% of organizations have deployed AI agents so far, but 42% expect to do so in the next 12 months, and another 22% within the following year." (p.2)

## Signals
- Production agent workflows have named checkpoint roles, not fire-and-forget triggers.
- Override and intervention rates are tracked as first-class metrics, not afterthoughts.
- The autonomy level per workflow is documented and reviewed, not assumed.
- Failure modes (hallucination, tool misuse, infinite loops) have named mitigations, not "trust the model".

## Counter-evidence
Gartner's framing under-weights the rate of model improvement, what is "not ready" in Q1 2026 may be ready by Q3 2026. Also, the semi-autonomy default can become a permanent posture that prevents the org from learning what fully autonomous deployments actually require. Operators should treat semi-autonomy as the current best practice, not a permanent ceiling.
