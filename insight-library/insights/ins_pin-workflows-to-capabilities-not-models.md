# Pin workflows to capabilities you re-baseline quarterly, not to a model snapshot

## Claim
Model progress is not tapering; every few months something previously impossible becomes easy, and the size of the leaps grows. The operating implication for any AI-native flywheel commitment: pin workflows to capability classes you can re-baseline each quarter, not to one model snapshot.

## Mechanism
Workflows hardcoded to a specific model version inherit that model's failure modes and miss the gains of the next release. Capability-pinned workflows (e.g. "long-context summarization at quality X") survive model swaps and benefit from each upgrade.

## Conditions
Holds when: the team has a quarterly cadence to re-evaluate model choice per workflow.
Fails when: a workflow depends on a model-specific quirk that capability framing doesn't capture (rare).

## Evidence
> "Every few months a new model arrives... something that was impossible becomes easy, while the size of the leaps grows each new release cycle."

## Signals
- Workflow specs name capability requirements, not model IDs.
- Quarterly model bake-offs run as a standing scheduler task.
- Long-form fiction or other rough-edge tasks flagged with explicit caveats per release.

## Counter-evidence
For regulated or audited workflows, model-pinning is required for reproducibility, capability framing can't override compliance.
