# Brand work as "research preview" to compress timelines from quarters to weeks

## Claim
Label new features explicitly as "research preview" to lower the commitment cost of shipping. The reduced expectation lets the team release in a week or two, gather real usage data, and iterate; the tradeoff (less polish at launch) is offset by a published cadence of follow-up shipments.

## Mechanism
Most launch friction is reputational: "if we ship this and it breaks, the brand suffers." Pre-naming the artifact as a preview pre-commits the audience to incremental quality. The team then earns trust via *iteration cadence*, not initial polish. This unsticks the multi-quarter alignment-then-ship pattern that crushes velocity in older orgs.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The team can actually iterate weekly. Promising a research preview and going dark for a month destroys trust faster than waiting.
- The product surface tolerates change. APIs and core flows are higher-stakes than experimental features.

Fails when:
- The audience expects production stability (e.g., enterprise compliance, regulated industries).
- "Research preview" becomes a permanent label dodging accountability, at some point the work has to graduate.

## Evidence
> "We try to ship most features in research preview within a week. The way you lose trust around quality is by releasing something early and then nothing happens after."

· Cat Wu on Lenny's Podcast, 2026-04-27

Cat's team timelines collapsed from 6 months to 1 month to 1 week to 1 day. Engineers post in an "evergreen launch room" the moment a feature is dog-fooded; Sarah (Docs), Alex (PMM), and DevRel turn around the marketing announcement the next day.

## Signals
- Time from "feature dog-fooded" to "publicly available" is measured in days.
- Each preview has at least one shipped iteration within two weeks.
- Brand and docs teams treat preview launches as default work, not exception work.

## Counter-evidence
Jenny Wen (Anthropic Design): non-deterministic AI products *cannot* be mocked, so research-preview is the only honest mode. For deterministic products with stable APIs, traditional GA discipline still wins because users expect contracts, not iterations. The pattern transfers most cleanly to AI-native and consumer-discovery products and least cleanly to platform / API surfaces with SLAs.

## Cross-references
- `ins_prds-replaced-by-metrics-and-principles`, the doc-light culture this cadence assumes
- `ins_engineers-with-product-taste`, the staffing pattern that makes weekly preview shipping feasible
