# Agents work when treated as a team, not a single super-tool

## Claim
Don't throw every task at one AI agent. Build one agent per role, each with its own context window, identity, and tool scope, and manage them like teammates.

## Mechanism
Context is the bottleneck for agent quality, not raw model capability. A single agent asked to do nine jobs accumulates conflicting context across them and degrades on each. Splitting work across role-scoped agents keeps each agent's context window clean, lets you onboard each to one job, and lets you grant tool access per-role rather than per-account.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The work decomposes into stable, namable roles (sales SDR, exec assistant, research analyst).
- You have the operating discipline to maintain per-agent identity files and tool inventories.

Fails when:
- Roles are amorphous or shift weekly. The agent count thrash is worse than a generalist.
- The org has no per-agent provisioning (shared logins, shared inboxes). The security and audit costs swamp the productivity gain.

## Evidence
> "Where people stumble with OpenClaw is they think they can throw any task at a single agent and get great results."
>
> "I have nine Slack channels. My marketing team's in one, sales in another, dev in another. My development team does not care what was posted on X today."
>
> Claire ran nine agents on three Mac Minis: Polly (work EA), Finn (family), Sam (sales SDR), Howie (podcast research), Sage (course PM), Q (kids' tutor), and others. Sam-the-SDR replaced 10 hours/week of contractor work running PLG sweeps and drafting soft outreach.

## Signals
- Per-agent context windows stay focused (no cross-domain bleed).
- Each agent has a single named owner role and a single tool set.
- New work either fits an existing agent or warrants a new one with its own identity, not a feature added to a generalist.
- Agents that misbehave are corrected via tool inventory or identity edits, not via a stronger model.

## Counter-evidence
A single very strong general agent (e.g., long-context Claude with broad tool access) can outperform a poorly-managed team of small agents. The win is in the management discipline, not the architecture itself. Operators who can't maintain identity + tool docs may get worse outcomes from the team approach.

## Cross-references
- `ins_progressive-trust-onboarding`, how to ramp a new agent or teammate onto tools
- `ins_manager-skill-not-technical`, why the unlock is management, not engineering
- `ins_llm-wiki-pattern`, the substrate that makes per-agent context durable
