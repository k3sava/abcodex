# Onboard agents the way you onboard an EA: progressive trust, named tiers

## Claim
Stage tool access for AI agents in named tiers (read calendar → read mail → draft mail → send mail), the same way you'd ramp a new executive assistant. Don't hand over full account access on day one.

## Mechanism
Trust ramps mitigate two failure modes at once: alignment (the agent learns your style on low-stakes work before it does anything irreversible) and security (a compromised agent has bounded blast radius at each stage). Treating provisioning as a ladder forces explicit decisions about what each agent should be able to do, instead of one big "give it admin" moment.

## Conditions
Works when:
- Tools have granular permissions (read-only tokens, draft-only roles, send-with-review hooks).
- The team has the discipline to actually advance agents through stages on observed behavior.

Fails when:
- The tool stack is all-or-nothing (no read-only API mode). Operators end up granting full access for any utility.
- The org culture treats permission tiers as bureaucracy rather than operating hygiene.

## Evidence
> "You don't onboard your EA by giving the password to your email account... they have their own email, they have their own calendar, and you give them access or permission."
>
> "First you get my calendar, then you can read my email, then I guess you could draft some emails, then you can send the emails."

## Signals
- Each agent has a documented permission tier, not a yes/no access list.
- New tool access requires an explicit ramp decision, not a default-on grant.
- Audit logs show agents using only the tools at their current tier.

## Counter-evidence
No opposing view in current corpus.

## Cross-references

- `ins_manager-skill-not-technical` — the operator skill needed to run the ramp
