# LLM platform is the new OS, agents are the new apps, MCP registries are the new app stores

## Claim
The platform-layer hierarchy is shifting. LLM platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) are becoming the OS layer, the surface through which enterprise workflows are conducted. Domain-specific agents are becoming the apps. MCP registries are becoming the app stores. SaaS that depends on a UI is being demoted to back-end infrastructure that the LLM-OS calls.

## Mechanism
Once an LLM is the daily driver for knowledge work, the user no longer goes to twelve different SaaS UIs, they ask the LLM, which calls APIs (often via MCP) on its agents' behalf. The SaaS app stops competing for the user's attention; it competes to be the best-callable infrastructure. UI investments depreciate; API surface, data quality, and agent-friendliness appreciate. Same pattern as Windows demoting MS-DOS apps, iOS demoting feature-phone apps.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- LLM platforms continue to invest in tool-using and multi-step workflows (current trajectory of Anthropic + OpenAI + Google).
- Enterprises adopt LLM-platform clients as default knowledge-work surfaces (already true at the margin).

Fails when:
- LLM platforms hit a regulatory ceiling that forces them back into narrower assistant roles.
- Closed-data enterprises (regulated finance, healthcare) maintain UI-bound workflows because data residency and audit trails forbid LLM-mediated calls.
- A vertical's complexity exceeds what an agent layer can mediate, UI primacy returns where domain depth dominates.

## Evidence
> "Every SaaS product that depends on a user interface is about to become back-end infrastructure."
>
> "Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini are competing to become the surface through which all enterprise workflows are conducted. The same way Windows became the surface for desktop computing."
>
> "The LLM platform is the new OS. Domain-specific agents are the new apps. MCP registries are the new app stores."
>
> "Anthropic and OpenAI are building operating systems."

## Signals
- Vendor product roadmaps prioritise MCP servers, OpenAPI specs, and agent-friendly auth over UI redesigns.
- Pricing discussions shift from seat-based UI usage toward API/token consumption models.
- Customer references describe their workflow as "I asked Claude…" rather than "I logged into the tool…".
- Analyst categories add "agent-readable" as an evaluation dimension.

## Counter-evidence
The OS analogy under-weights the lock-in counter-pressure: incumbents (Salesforce, Microsoft) are racing to be their own LLM-OS rather than ceding the surface to Anthropic/OpenAI. Whether the OS layer consolidates to 2–3 LLM platforms or fragments across 10+ vertical agents is unsettled. Operators should plan for both shapes. Also, "demoted to infrastructure" still sustains substantial businesses (AWS, Stripe), the demotion isn't extinction.

## Cross-references
- `ins_software-is-not-a-moat`, Evan Spiegel; software alone doesn't defend the position.
- `ins_post-training-as-the-moat`, Asha Sharma; the data layer is what survives the demotion.
- `ins_rebuild-gtm-around-ai`, Kieran Flanagan; GTM has to follow the platform shift, not bolt onto it.
