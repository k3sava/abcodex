# AI has crossed the threshold to something indistinguishable from judgment and taste — winners will know what to build, not how

## Claim
Six years building AI products at the frontier, and the threshold has been crossed: describe what you want built in plain English, walk away for four hours, return to a finished product the AI tested and iterated to its own quality standard. The critical development isn't raw capability — it's the emergence of something that functions like judgment and taste. Practical implication: technical work is being commoditized faster than most people comprehend; winners will be those who understand what to build, not how to build it.

## Mechanism
Two-pass workflow for production AI development: first pass generates initial code; second "cleanup prompt" transforms messy output into maintainable, production-ready code. Acknowledges first-draft AI output works but lacks organizational quality for long-term maintenance. Prompt engineering is now an engineering discipline with measurable outputs (Shumer's open-source GPT-Prompt-Engineer automates testing and optimization across models). Prompt expansion (using AI to refine user prompts before model invocation) was pioneered at HyperWrite and adopted by DALL-E 3, Ideogram.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The work is tractable to current frontier model capabilities.
- The operator has enough taste to evaluate AI output and direct it.

Fails when:
- Highly regulated or compliance-heavy domains where AI output requires verification at the line level.
- Domains where current models still produce subtly wrong output that looks right.

## Evidence
> "We have crossed the threshold where AI demonstrates something indistinguishable from judgment and taste — the practical implication is that technical work is being commoditized at a pace most people cannot comprehend."

> "The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have."

— Matt Shumer (synthesized from operator's published work)

## Signals
- Development workflow includes a two-pass cleanup step explicitly designed for AI-generated code.
- Prompt engineering has measurable outputs and version control, not one-off chat sessions.
- Decisions about what to build now precede decisions about how, not the reverse.

## Counter-evidence
Practitioners disagree on whether current models genuinely have "taste" or whether the appearance of judgment is statistical pattern-matching that breaks on novel domains. Cat Wu's 100% automation rule cuts the other way: if human polish is still needed, it isn't real autonomy.
