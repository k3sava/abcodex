# PMs who keep outsourcing first artifact will lose to PMs who arrive at design review with a working prototype

## Claim
The PM-to-design handoff is collapsing the way PM-to-engineer collapsed two years ago; PMs who keep outsourcing their first artifact will compete with PMs who arrive at design review with a working AI-built prototype, and the latter will own the room.

## Mechanism
AI design tooling (Claude Design and equivalents) lowers the cost of producing a working prototype to within a single PM's budget. A PM who shows up to design review with a prototype frames the discussion around critique, iteration, and tradeoffs (concrete) rather than vision and intent (abstract). The designer's first job shifts from creation to critique, and the PM accelerates the loop. PMs who don't make this shift lose ground because their requirements documents read as theoretical against peers who ship working artifacts.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- AI design tooling is good enough to produce credible prototypes for the product surface.
- The PM has the discipline to treat the prototype as a starting point, not the design.
- The design lead/team has the authority to own the visual system and approve before any user sees it.

Fails when:
- The category requires deep design craft early (luxury, brand-led products), AI prototypes look like AI prototypes.
- The PM lacks design literacy to critique their own AI output and ships unreviewed work.
- The design team treats AI prototypes as threats and the political cost overwhelms the speed gain.

## Evidence
> "[Claude Design is] the tool most PMs will be using in 6 months."

The frame: PMs who keep outsourcing first artifact to design will compete with PMs who arrive at design review with a working prototype. Same collapse PMs saw with engineering two years ago.

## Signals
- PM PRDs ship with working prototypes attached; design reviews open on the prototype, not the doc.
- Design lead approval becomes a named gate before user-facing testing.
- PM hiring expects prototype-fluency alongside writing and analytics.

## Counter-evidence
For high-craft product categories, the PM prototype can become an anchor that drags the final design toward AI defaults. Designers who feel critique-only roles are degrading the work may push back. The collapse story may move slower than predicted in regulated or design-heavy categories.
