# AI capability is not evenly distributed, it spikes where labs have data, rewards, and verification loops

## Claim
The map of AI capability in 2026 is not a smooth curve. It spikes sharply in domains where the labs have three things together: large training data, clean reward signals, and tight verification loops. Where any of those is missing, capability lags, sometimes by a lot. The strategic implication for any operator picking where to bet on AI: identify the verification-loop shape of the work first. If the work has it, AI capability will arrive fast; if it doesn't, automation is genuinely hard and the bet is wrong-sized.

## Mechanism
Lab progress follows the gradient of measurable success. Where outputs can be checked automatically (a unit test passes, a chess position evaluates, a math step is correct), the model gets clean signal at training time and improves quickly. Where outputs require human judgement to evaluate (most consumer writing, most strategic decisions, most creative work), the signal is sparse, expensive, and noisy, so capability arrives on a slower curve. Coding, math, formal reasoning, and well-bounded tool use have all three (data + rewards + verification) and have spiked. Open-ended consumer assistants, judgement-loaded calls, and verification-light domains haven't, and won't on the same timeline.

## Conditions
Holds when:
- The operator is making a 6-24 month capability bet (the framing is about gradient direction, not yesterday's snapshot).
- The team can honestly classify the verification-loop shape of the work in question.
- The org has the discipline to act on the classification rather than rationalising any work as "AI-ready."

Fails when:
- The work is genuinely far enough out that today's gradient doesn't predict the 5-year answer (some long-horizon capability surprises do happen).
- The classification is fake, operators claim a verification loop exists when it doesn't, and budget AI work that won't deliver.
- The lab landscape changes (a new evaluator, a new feedback paradigm) and a previously-stuck domain becomes verifiable. Re-check the classification on a cadence.

## Evidence
> "AI capability is not evenly distributed. It spikes in places where labs have data, rewards, and verification loops."
· Andrej Karpathy, Sequoia AI Ascent 2026 fireside recap, 2026-04-30.

The same talk's complementary claim, "you can outsource thinking, you can't outsource understanding" (see `ins_judgment-vs-understanding`), is the human-side mirror. Capability spikes where verification works; human comparative advantage stays in domains where it doesn't.

## Signals
- Investment in AI tooling tracks the verification-loop shape of the target workflow, not its hype cycle position.
- The team can answer, for any AI bet: "what's the reward signal, who verifies, on what cadence?"
- Roadmap sequencing puts data-and-verification-rich automations before judgement-rich ones, regardless of which feels more impressive.

## Counter-evidence
- The framing under-rates capability emergence: some surprises (in-context learning, long-context reasoning) appeared without obvious verification-loop antecedents. Don't treat the rule as deterministic.
- For operators with no near-term capability decision to make, the framing is less actionable; it's a strategic-bet diagnostic, not a daily-work guide.

## Cross-references
- `ins_judgment-vs-understanding`, the human side of the same diagnosis: where verification is missing, judgement is irreplaceable.
- `ins_traces-need-feedback-to-learn` and `ins_mine-transcripts-to-promote-config`, verification loops are the substrate that makes learning possible at all; without them, no system improves.
