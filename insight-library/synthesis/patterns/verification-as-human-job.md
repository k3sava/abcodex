# Verification, not execution, is the irreplaceable human job

## Convergence
Three operators from completely separate lanes, agent frameworks, LLM evals, and AI research, published independently in the same week with the same core claim: the bottleneck of AI-native work is not intelligence, it is verification, and without feedback bound to every output, traces accumulate but systems don't actually learn. Karpathy from research, Chase from frameworks, Yan from evals. No coordination, same conclusion.

## Operators
- Andrej Karpathy, `ins_judgment-vs-understanding`. "You can outsource your thinking, but you can't outsource your understanding." Verification is the new human comparative advantage.
- Harrison Chase, `ins_traces-need-feedback-to-learn`. A trace tells you what happened, not whether it was good. Trace + feedback is the minimum learning unit.
- Eugene Yan, `ins_mine-transcripts-to-promote-config`. Close the feedback loop by mining session transcripts for promotable patterns. The corpus is the gym.

## Variation
- Karpathy frames it as a *role redesign*: humans move from production to verification.
- Chase frames it as an *infrastructure requirement*: feedback bound to traces is the missing primitive in most observability stacks.
- Yan frames it as an *operational practice*: transcript review and promotion-as-PR is how the loop closes in real work.
- Convergence: all three say execution is solved, verification is not, and any system that doesn't wire verification into the trace at design time will accumulate logs without learning.

## Implication
Audit any AI system in production for the verification + feedback path. Three diagnostic questions: (1) For each agent run, what's the feedback signal and where is it stored? (2) Can you produce, on demand, a list of runs that worked vs runs that didn't, with the diff between them? (3) When a prompt or tool gets "improved," is the change traceable to specific transcript-level evidence, or is it taste? If the answer to any is "we don't have that," the system is logging, not learning. The fix is not more traces, it's wiring feedback into the same store as the trace, then promoting patterns into config in a reviewable, reversible way.
