**B2B pricing pages drive agent fallback to third-party directories, chained web_fetch links enable private data exfiltration, and visual benchmarks have decoupled from frontier model rankings.** Three new cards from two operators. Indig with 1,500-run data showing pricing pages are where AI agent retrieval breaks down and directories take over. Willison with the chained-link exfiltration attack that bypassed Anthropic's injection safeguards. Willison again on the pelican benchmark losing its predictive value as agentic tool-calling reliability becomes the frontier differentiator.

<!-- LATEST:END -->

A primary-source library of operator insights. Atomic claims, each one attributed to a named operator with a verifiable source URL and date. Built so you can read one claim, verify the source, and cite it.

## What's in here today

<!-- COUNTS:START -->
- **954** insight cards
- **500** operator profiles
- **45** synthesis patterns (cross-operator convergences)
- **11** documented contradictions
- **28** methodology playbooks
- **209** archived raw sources (podcasts, essays, threads, research)
<!-- COUNTS:END -->

Every card carries: operator, role, source URL, source date, claim, mechanism, conditions when it applies, evidence, signals to track, counter-evidence, and links to related cards.

The site at [abcodex.iamkesava.com](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/) gives you several ways to read the same corpus:

| View | What it's for |
|------|---------------|
| [Home](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/) | Tier A claims and a domain index |
| [Map](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/map) | Visual graph: operators outside, domains in the middle, insights orbiting between |
| [Operators](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/operators) | All 500 profiles, sorted by card count |
| [Patterns](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/patterns) | Where 3+ operators converge on the same claim |
| [Browse](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/browse) | Filter by tier or domain, sort by date / operator / tier |
| [Timeline](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/timeline) | Newest captures first |
| [Flash](https://abcodex.iamkesava.com/#/flash) | One card at a time, prev/next/shuffle |

Press `⌘K` (or `Ctrl-K`) anywhere to search across operators, claims, and patterns.

## What you'll find

Cross-domain operator wisdom across Product, PMM, GTM, Growth, Design, Engineering, AI-native operating, Leadership, Sales/CS, Research, and Founder craft. A structured, primary-source record of what operators have published, with the source URL attached to every claim.

## Using the corpus from another project

The `INDEX.json` at `insight-library/INDEX.json` is the canonical index. Every record carries `id`, `path`, `operator`, `source_url`, `source_date`, `domain`, `lifecycle`, `tier`. Read it directly, link to cards by id, or fetch their markdown bodies at the listed paths.

If you only want a subset, filter `INDEX.json` by `tier`, `domain`, or `operator`. Don't copy the cards into your own repo. Link to them so updates propagate.

## Contributing

The ingest protocol is in [`insight-library/00_meta/INGEST-PROTOCOL.md`](insight-library/00_meta/INGEST-PROTOCOL.md). Every card needs a named operator, a verifiable source URL, a date, and the standard schema fields. No paraphrase-grade attribution; no invented metrics; no fabricated sources.

When you add or change cards, regenerate the index:

```
node scripts/build-index.mjs
```

The site reads from `insight-library/INDEX.json` and rebuilds itself on every push to `main` via the GitHub Pages workflow.
