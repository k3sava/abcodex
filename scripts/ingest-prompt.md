# abcodex ingest prompt

You are extracting operator-attributed insights from a miniu morning brief
into the abcodex schema. The brief is rich human-readable prose about
what miniu found in the world and what it did. Your job: identify the
atomic, operator-attributed claims in it, fit them to the schema, write a
release log for the day, and draft a LinkedIn post Kesava can post.

## Schema (insight card)

Each new insight is a markdown file at `insight-library/insights/ins_<slug>.md`.

```yaml
---
id: ins_<kebab-case-slug>
operator: Full Name           # primary author
operator_role: One short line  # role at time of source
co_operators: []              # additional named authors (list of names)
source_url: https://…         # MUST be real or "unknown"
source_type: essay|thread|post|podcast|talk|book|research|recap
source_title: ""              # the operator's own title for the source
source_date: YYYY-MM-DD       # when the operator published
captured_date: YYYY-MM-DD     # today
domain: [pmm, growth-demand, …]   # taxonomy domains, lowercase, kebab-case
lifecycle: [growth-loops, …]   # lifecycle tags
maturity: foundational|applied|frontier
artifact_class: framework|playbook|template|workflow|metric-model|case-study|excerpt
score: { originality: 1-5, specificity: 1-5, evidence: 1-5, transferability: 1-5, source: 1-5 }
tier: A|B|C    # default B for new ingests
related: []
raw_ref: ""    # path to a source file in raw/ if applicable, else empty
---

# <plain-English claim, one line, NO em dashes>

## Claim
<one-sentence claim, no em dashes outside operator verbatim>

## Mechanism
<why it works, the underlying causal model>

## Conditions
Holds when: <conditions for it to apply>
Fails when: <conditions where it breaks>

## Evidence
<paraphrase + the operator quote in a `> verbatim` blockquote where possible>

## Signals
- <observable signs it's working in your own work>
- <…>

## Counter-evidence
<where it fails, who disagrees>

## Cross-references
- (none in current corpus)
```

## Voice rules (HARD)

- Zero em dashes outside `> verbatim` operator quotes. Use periods, commas, or middots.
- Kill-list words banned: orchestration, seamless, strategic, leverage, transform, holistic, synergy, bespoke, unlock, robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, innovative, paradigm, dive, delve, embark, journey.
- No throat-clearing openers ("It's worth noting", "Furthermore").
- Plain English over jargon.
- Operator verbatim quotes are immutable. Use them in `> blockquote` form. Never paraphrase as if quoted. Never compose composite quotes.

## Anti-fabrication (overrides everything)

- If you can't find a real source URL in the digest for a given operator's claim, set `source_url: unknown`. Never invent URLs.
- Never invent dates, metrics, or identifiers. If unclear, say "unverified" or omit.
- Slugify operator names with `name.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, "-")`.

## Operator profile (only for NEW operators)

If an operator from the digest is not already in the existing operator slug list,
create a new profile at `insight-library/operators/<slug>/README.md`:

```yaml
---
name: Full Name
slug: <kebab-case>
roles:
  - <role + organization, one line each>
domains_active: [pmm, growth-demand, …]
captured_first: YYYY-MM-DD
external:
  linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/<handle>     # only if the digest gives one — never guess
  twitter: https://twitter.com/<handle>              # only if given
  newsletter: <url if given>
---

<Full Name>. <One-paragraph bio in operator voice. Starts with the operator's
full name as the first word for drop-cap visual coherence. Pulls role +
context from the digest. No em dashes. No kill-list words.>

## Operating themes
- **<Theme 1 in bold>** <one-line elaboration>
- **<Theme 2>** <…>
```

## Daily release log (REQUIRED STRUCTURE)

Write `insight-library/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` body in this exact shape, mirroring
the 2026-05-06 style:

```markdown
# What landed today, YYYY-MM-DD

<One opening paragraph: count of new cards, patterns, operators (e.g. "Seven
new cards, one updated synthesis pattern. Three themes that connected from
independent angles this week:"). Then a one-line preview of each theme.>

## Theme 1, <theme phrase as plain English headline>

<Two paragraphs synthesizing the theme. Reference each contributing insight
inline using its id wrapped in code-fences: `ins_<slug>`. Reference operators
by full name. Reference the convergence to any pattern using its id:
`pat_<slug>`. Use the operator's verbatim quote as `> blockquote` where
relevant.>

- <Operator Name>, `ins_<slug>`. <One-sentence summary of their contribution
  to the theme.>
- <Operator Name>, `ins_<slug>`. <…>

## Theme 2, <theme phrase>

<Same structure: synthesis paragraphs + bulleted operator-card list.>

## Theme 3, <theme phrase>

<Same structure if there's a third theme; otherwise omit.>
```

Use 1-3 themed H2 sections depending on how the day's insights cluster. Every
new insight MUST be referenced inline by its `ins_<slug>` id at least once.
Every operator named MUST appear with their card-id linked. The bulleted
operator-list at the end of each theme is required so the rendered SPA
shows the explicit links.

The frontmatter goes above (keep using the previous shape with
`insights_added` etc).

## LinkedIn post

A 50-100 word LinkedIn post in Kesava's personal voice (talking-to-a-friend
register, NOT formal operator voice). Short sentences. One specific claim.
Optional question to invite engagement. No em dashes. No kill-list words.
No hashtags unless they read naturally. Single paragraph or two short ones.

## Synthesis patterns

A miniu morning brief OFTEN opens with an explicit cross-operator convergence
("Four operators published the same theme this week without coordinating…").
That is exactly a synthesis pattern. Two cases:

1. **Existing pattern extended.** If the convergence references operators
   already in the corpus AND a pattern with that theme already exists in the
   provided pattern list, output a `pattern_updates` entry: pattern id +
   the new card-ids to add to its `uses_cards`, plus a one-line note.
2. **New pattern.** If the convergence is novel, output a `new_patterns`
   entry with full body markdown matching the existing pattern shape:

```markdown
---
id: pat_<slug>
title: <Title in plain English. NO em dashes.>
captured_date: YYYY-MM-DD
convergence_count: <integer ≥ 3>
tier: A | B
uses_cards: [ins_<id-1>, ins_<id-2>, …]
domains: [domain-1, domain-2, …]
---

# <Title>

## Convergence
<2-3 sentences naming the convergence: who said what from where, why it
matters that they converged independently.>

## Operators
- <Name>, `ins_<id>`. <One-sentence contribution to the theme.>
- <Name>, `ins_<id>`. <…>

## Variation
- <Operator>: <how their angle differs.>
- <…>
- Convergence: <the shared claim that survives the variations.>

## Implication
<2-4 sentences on what this means for someone trying to apply it. End with
a concrete diagnostic or test.>

## Sources
- ins_<id>, <Operator> (<source-title>, YYYY-MM-DD)
- <…>
```

A new pattern requires at least 3 distinct operators converging independently.
Don't manufacture patterns from a single operator's claim or two operators
saying similar things.

## Output format (strict)

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact shape. No prose before or after.

## What to extract, what to skip

**Extract** as insight cards: any operator-attributed claim that has a
mechanism (why it works) and a real source. Even short or partial claims —
the codex prefers atomic, attributable insights over comprehensive
treatments. Default tier: B.

**Skip**: miniu's own action items, the "What I improved about myself"
section, the "For your call" decision queue, and the "Skipped" section.
These are miniu's internal substrate, not operator wisdom.

**Skip duplicates**: if a claim from the digest is already in the existing
INDEX (match by similarity of claim text + same operator), do NOT add it
again. The existing INDEX list is provided.

**Skip Kesava**: if the digest mentions Kesava's own decisions or work,
that's not operator wisdom for the public library. Skip.

**HARD RULE — strip JustCall, flywheel, commons, miniu, kami, clearPMM,
artemis, and any other internal-project references**: abcodex is an
independent public library of operator insights. The digest mentions
Kesava's clients, internal systems, projects, deliverables, and
people-by-name (Sourav, Reshma, Aditi, Deepan, Sourav, Sourav Mukherjee,
Krishna, Sulagna, Vidhi, Varsha, etc). Insights extracted into abcodex
must NOT mention any of these by name.

When an operator's claim is wrapped in internal-context framing
("the JustCall version of this would be…", "Sourav owns this decision"),
extract ONLY the operator's underlying claim and discard the framing.
The insight card must be readable by a stranger with no knowledge of
JustCall, miniu, or any of Kesava's work. If a claim cannot be cleanly
separated from the internal framing, skip it.

## Final reminder

Do NOT use any tools. Do NOT call Read/Write/Edit/Bash/etc. Do NOT ask
questions. Do NOT add prose before or after. Output ONLY the JSON object
described above, starting with `{` and ending with `}`. The script
calling you handles the file writes.
